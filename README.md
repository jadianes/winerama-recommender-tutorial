The idea is that you can follow the **tutorials** through the **tags** listed below, and learn the different concepts explained in them. The tutorials include instructions on how to deploy the web using a [Koding account](https://koding.com/).     

## Tutorials  

The following tutorials will guide you through each of the previous Git tags while learning different 
concepts of data product development with Python.
